# Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag (PC)
This is the homepage of AC4 docs for the revival of PC online services.

The game was built with [Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Anvil) engine which incorporated networking middleware SDK produced by Quazal Technologies.

AC4 was the first title in the franchise to use Hacknet middleware, which introduced major changes to the original RMC protocol.
